### Question 1

Possible plays are 5-6, 5-6 (alt)

### Question 2

They must be. If they were any other cards (even if they were a pair adding up to eleven) would necessarily leave at least one card still on the table, losing the game for you.

### Question 3

The game is mainly based around luck. If you have more than one possible match, you can perhaps employ a strategy based on the commonality of the unshuffled cards (i.e. count cards), but in my experience, that situation occurs fairly rarely, and I usually lose long before I am forced to make those decisions. So, I am forced to conclude that this game is based more on one's luck than on the strategy one employs.
